(i can't beleave i'm doing this)
what it does:
 - if you have 75/150 riding skill, it should set it to 150/150
how to use it:
 - search this text in player.cpp : "DEV, PLEASE PIMP MY RIDE"
 - uncomment the next 2 lines lines , recompile and use

ps. This should not do no harm. You can use it even if you didn't get reports from player. You can use it in other revisions too, i'm just giving an example how to fix it for all players from emu side.
Will remove code after a few revisions since this has no place in a working rev.

* Tweaked movement to about the best it is going to get. To the people complaining about lag/skipping issues, get a better computer! You will get movement skipping if the other player is getting below about 10fps I found to be the bare minimum for smooth movement. This makes sense, because if they're lagging it can't process input quick enough, therefore it skips, it's like lag, except the client tries to compensate for it, so instead of it moving from one place to another in a "jerk" fashion, it will "skip" as the client tries to interpolate the position. There is *nothing* we can do about this server-side really, except encourage players to lower their settings or upgrade their specs. (from compboy: "BUY AN X850, FAG, ITS ONLY 100 BUCKS)

cooldown = casttime + duration + spcooldown (sice you are using mob spells most of the time spcooldown=0, casttime=0 (instant), Duration=0 if not aura ...maybe people will come with better formulas here)
if you wish to use this formula then execute this query 
update ai_agents set spellCooldown=-1 where spellCooldown=0

> ascent.exe!std::_Tree<std::_Tmap_traits<unsigned int,TimedEvent *,std::less<unsigned int>,std::allocator<std::pair<unsigned int const ,TimedEvent *> >,1> >::insert(_Val=(13,0x3b3e1960 {obj=0x1446a130 cb=0x2d93bb58 eventType=13 ...})) Line 478 + 0x6 bytes C++
ascent.exe!EventableObject::event_AddEvent(ptr=0x3b3e1960) Line 58 + 0x22 bytes C++

This is some not default enabled trainer spell list storage loading (long word :P) code. Basicly it will load a Mangos like (client requires to be like this) list to be loaded.
Old code is kept since it's nice and sexy but lately i get some wierd trainer lists that need patching to be ok. So why not just use an unpatched list? Feel free to come with ideas how it can get improved.
Anyway chech the "general.todo" to know when you could use it cause it is NTY :P

* Copied enum handler from clusterserver to main server. This routine is a lot faster, has no Player class memory allocations or Item allocations, and also does the whole thing in a lot less sql queries. Simply put, when a lot of people are connecting at once it'll mean less strain on the db and less "retreiving char list" time.

  `zoneId` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `hordeEntry` int(10) unsigned default NULL,
  `allianceEntry` int(10) unsigned default NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

- speed reduction takes into count modifiers
- speed reduction should not make people walk backwards (what are the ods of this ? )
- speed reduction does not send updatepacket unless speed changed
- no force for resurrection in instances (some say this is correct)
- lowered seal of justice proc chance to 20% (have no idea of correct value)
- started working on troll berserking
- holy shock gets it's value dinamically now (some people reported huge dmg here)
- windfurry totem make 2xstrike instead of 2xdmg
- started working on balckout
- Holly shield effect was mixed up with shield specialization.
- confuse effect also pacifies target (is this good for all spells ? )
- fixed proc loop that made rogue ruthlesness add 2 combo points
- distract effect does not block the mob forever
- distract does not pull the mob, should make it look to a direction (sometimes works kinda wierd, related to facing )

I'm still not back just taking a moment of relaxation :P

* Reverted change in Setup.cpp file made in rev. 909.

Note to author of commit number 909:
- Leave notes about changes made in other files as in rev. 909 comment I can't find any note about disabling MOST scripts in Setup.cpp.
- I also couldn't find reason why that should be done as I am not able to find any crashes related to scripts included in Antrix Script Project.
- Also I don't really understand why this should be commented. If someone doesn't want to use those scripts (and I presume most ppl would like to have instances with casting spell mobs) he/she can easily comment them.

- Unfortunately for most of our antrix users, this cluster system will not be public. (Too bad, since I plan on integrating cross-realm battlegrounds and all sorts of cool stuff). Due to people making money off our work (wowscape, burningwow, hswow, just to name a few). Don't even bother trying to compile with the CLUSTERING define on, since the files necessary to do it have not been committed.
. Have a nice day.

Note: It's last official commit from me. Good dreams don't least for ever. I hope you guys can make with Antrix many amazing things. Wish you luck. It was great time spent on scripting and discussion. I will never forget that. Thx to all who supported me. My heart will stay with you.

+ Escort Quest Support!! Via GM script, you are able to create blizzlike escort-style quests, both ones where you have to follow a npc, or protect it. I will put an example script up on svn later.

Changes in Black Temple raid script:
* Fixed Akama wps. Now it will go correctly from door to Illidan position.
+ Added dialog between Akama and Illidan after which Illidan is attackable (but Akama doesn't join fight - must find way to change that)
+ Added more stuff to Illidan. Now phase 2 works, but it doesn't contains all it's spells and other needed stuff. What I added is spawning 2 Flames of Azzinoth by pushing them into world (spell way doesn't work yet =( ) and casting blue fireball spell by Illidan which doesn't make dmg :O (no idea why, with method "TARGET_ATTACKING" it wasn't even casted, with "TARGET_DESTINATION" it is casted, but no dmg so I left visual effect :P)
+ Added connection between phase 1 and phase 3 (now you must take care of Flames of Azzinoth before phase 3 will start)
+ Added Flame of Azzinoth script without spells to connect phases

TO DO: Check if there is timer change avaible (I found why it was only used when InCombat :D) and if it is synchronizate trasformation and it's reversion. Also add more spells to phases (mostly phase 2). Add Phase 5 with Maiev appearing etc. Add death scene. (anything was skiped?)

Test it and report back.

Note: This script is done with possible crash system. Be careful when using it! I will fix this in future updates!

* Cleaned Instance_TheSlavePens.cpp with useless stuff.

*All needs heavy tests (especially mobs with spells with TARGET_VARIOUS as this can cause crashes if they hit casters too [and can kill them = crash]).
