General
-Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider

Talents - Affliction
-Shadow Mastery: for some reason only applies to rank 1 skills. Doesn't apply to drain spells. Only uses base spell damage, not total spell damage after +damage is taken into consideration.
-Fel Concentration: somewhat works, proc rate for cast time reduction seems to be less than 75% at maximum lvl
-Empowered corruption: does not add any damage to corruption as it should (+36% at maximum lvl)

Talents - Destruction
-Intensity: has no noticable effect (supposed to give 70% at max lvl to reduce the chance of spell interruption).
-Shadow and Flame: is supposed to give +20% damage to shadowbolt and incinerate but doesn't.
-Emberstorm: only applies to base damage, not damage after spell casts.

Talents - Demonology
-Soul link: does not transfer 20% of damage to pet or give the +5% damage
-Demonic Sacrifice: Working, though fire damage gained from imp and shadow damage gained from succubus and felguard are applied to base spell damage, not total spell damage after all other effects. Also, ff you use Demonic Sacrifice and log out with no pet, your character will show a Voidwalker next to them. When you log onto another character than back on to your lock, you'll have both the Demonic Sacrifice you used, and a Voidwalker out. Sacrificing this one would make 2 Sacrifices stack.

Pets
-Pets on defense/passive immediately attacks the closest enemy if it kills the current mob. It also immediately attacks the closest enemy if it is just summoned or from log in.

General (might affect more then just warlocks)
- Should receive soul shard when pet is dismissed due to out of range or getting on windrider
- Temporary +spell damage buffs (trinkets, potions, etc) will only apply the +damage to DoT's while the effect is in place - Not when you start the spell cast. For example, say you used a trinket that gives +150 spell damage. You apply Corruption and Unstable Affliction. You gain the +150 spell damage bonus as normal - your Unstable Affliction and Corruption should gain around 25 damage a tick. Half way through the ticks, the trinket wears off. You will now LOSE that 25 damage a tick, even though the DoT was applied when you initiated the cast.

Hellfire/Rain of fire - must have a target selected else it will stop channeling immediately; channeling isn't affected by talent to reduce spell pushback; starts damaging only after good 3-4 seconds of channel.

Curse of Agony:
- Causes the "beginning damage" throughout the whole spell cast, making it to do much less damage than it should. (Its damage should ramp up <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Curse_of_Agony" target="_blank">http://www.wowwiki.com/Curse_of_Agony</a>

Curse of Doom:
- Works, but only gets 100% bonus from spell damage instead of 200%.

Life Tap:
- works, but it can kill you with durability loss

Eye of krilrogg:
- Summons the eye, but you can control it only in OLs, and after moving a bit further away, you stop the channeling and disconnect 50% of the time. D/c 7/12 times already.

Summon Infernal:
- No 200 damage stun. Dismissing the infernal won't release him from his chains and send him wild, but instead just disappear. Does less damage than normal.

Enslave demon:
- Does not have any effect on demons.

Doom guard:
- Proc (from curse of doom) and summoning (from ritual of doom) does not work.

Ritual of soul:
- Creates the soul well but does not allow raid members to extract a healthstone from it.

Fear mechanics need to be worked on, a little latency just breaks up all the effect, its not ever worth casting fear in pvp.

Demons:
- Demons should get dismissed when mounted and get back when dismounted.

Summoned demons DO NOT get any stats from the warlock such as health or mana resulting in one-shot kills in raid or pvp environment.

SUCCUBUS:

- Seduction seduces self or does nothing.
- Lash of pain attacks rapidly as described above.
- Soothing kiss - doesn't work.

VOIDWALKER:

- Consume shadows can work in combat making it available to solo instances lol.
- Suffering seems to taunt mob in a VAST area, once taunted whole stormwind.
- Torment does nothing.

FELHUNTER:

- Paranoia seems to work, or maybe stealth is gimped, I see stealthed people like 20 yards away.
- Tainted blood puts the buff on but it does nothing.
- Devour magic doesnt remove any buffs ever.
- Spell lock doesn't work anymore (it did).

FELGUARD:

- Cleave attacks rapidly but only one target and most likely will attack self (could do ~100k dps if really wanted)
- The passive buffs don't work.

Affliction talents and spells:

IMPORTANT - Soul siphon doesn't work at all. Should increase amount drained by drain life by an additional 2/4% for each affliction effect up to maximum 24/60% (if you have max rank and 4 affliction debuffs on target, it would increase drain life spell by 16%. Whenever a debuff is applied, it increases by another 4% up to 60%).
- Improved life tap - does not work i think
- Improved drain soul - doesn't work. should give 7/14% of mana back after killing something while draining soul.
IMPORTANT - Siphon life - works but doesn't benefit from shadow damage so is useless.

Demonology:

- Improved health funnel. doesn't increase the health given to minion when channeling.
- improved enslave demon. the spell itself doesn't work.
- master conjuror. doesn't work. should increase effect of firestone and spellstone by 15/30%

- when infernal dies, server crashes

- put talent points into health funnel and see if caster dies like that
