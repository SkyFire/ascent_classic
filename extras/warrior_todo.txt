I'll talk more about prot wars here.
Shield block - This thing should block one attack which could be increased by using a talent which allows blocking 2 attack's.But it doesnt want to block anything nor using the str stat as the amout of damage blocked by your shield.1 talent,and it means much to a prot war.
Shiled slam - This is the ultimate prot war thing,by using the amout of shield block from items + it's own ability damage it slams you opponent right into his balls %) But the truth is that it just does the damage of the ability and not + shield block value.It should be like for example: you have somth like 100 shield block value,and this value is the amount of damage added to your shield slam,so if you hit for let's say 500 and +100 you have 600,simple.
Slam - the damage is fine,but the skill doesnt reset the normal attack,so it goes along whith the slam,making you have infinitive rage all the time.
Stance switch - correct me if i'm wrong,but switching removes all buffs debuffs from you.
- endless rage

- this got depracated, maybe update with new one ?
[23:52:39] Spell::cast 5301, Unit: 283
[23:52:39] WORLD: Spell effect id = 6, damage = 1
[23:52:39] WORLD: target = 283 , Spell Aura id = 42, SpellId  = 5301, i = 0, apply = true

//the problem is actually that spell dbc does not contain the 3rd effect as in description. It must be added manually
berserker stance - not working
berserker rage - does not get triggered on struck. it does not even have an onstruck spell to get triggered.
improved berserker rage - not triggered. Should only get triggered while we have aura "berserker rage" onstruck event

taunt - should pull creatures even if they are already attacking
shield block - should increase block chance to 75%- block does not ocure ?
