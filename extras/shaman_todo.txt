Elemental Tree
Elemental Fury - no effect - supposed to give a +100% crit damage on nature spells and fire totems
Earthbind Totem - It works vs other faction but not vs your own (fixed?), and vs mobs when it stacks with any other cripple effect a shaman has it makes the mob warp towards you at a very high speed (Usefull to control mobs still, BTW ;) )
Purge - Works well enough, in some cases it removes things it shouldent (Palidins bubble) and on some things it doesn't work at all (Priests Divine Spirit)
